## Entity Extraction Model using BERT

This project is the implementation of an Entity Extraction model using the BERT architecture. The model is trained on a [Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus) and leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library along with PyTorch for training and evaluation.

Here are some example outputs from the trained model:
